# facefrontalisation
This code implements a face frontalisation method given the landmarks 
This is the python code as a re-implementation of the matlab code from:
http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/frontalize/
Tal Hassner, Shai Harel*, Eran Paz* and Roee Enbar, Effective Face Frontalization in Unconstrained Images, IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Boston, June 2015
The algorithm credit belongs to them. 


I implement it as I dislike reading matlab code--you 
In order to make the code run you need: 

1. compile the dlib python code: http://dlib.net/

2. download the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2

3. install python dependencies
